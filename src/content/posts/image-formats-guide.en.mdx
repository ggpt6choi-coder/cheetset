# WebP vs PNG vs JPEG: Which Image Format Should You Use?

Images account for 50% of the average website's weight. Choosing the wrong format can slow down your site and hurt your SEO.

## JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)
- **Best for**: Photographs, complex images with many colors.
- **Pros**: Small file size, universal compatibility.
- **Cons**: Lossy compression (quality degrades), no transparency.

## PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
- **Best for**: Logos, icons, screenshots, images with text.
- **Pros**: Lossless compression (sharp quality), supports transparency.
- **Cons**: Large file size for photographs.

## WebP (Web Picture)
- **Best for**: Almost everything on the web.
- **Pros**: Superior compression (26% smaller than PNG, 25-34% smaller than JPEG), supports both transparency and animation.
- **Cons**: Older browsers (Internet Explorer) don't support it.

## Base64 Encoding

Sometimes, you might want to embed an image directly into your code as a string. This is called **Base64 encoding**.
It reduces the number of HTTP requests but increases the file size by about 33%.

## Tools for Developers

- Need to convert an image to a code string? Use our **[Image to Base64 Converter](/tools/image-to-base64)**.
- Have a Base64 string and want to see the image? Use our **[Base64 to Image Converter](/tools/base64-to-image)**.

## Conclusion

For modern websites, **WebP** is the winner. It offers the best balance of quality and file size.
However, understanding all formats is crucial for optimization.
