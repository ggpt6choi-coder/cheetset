# The Chaos of Measurement: Imperial vs Metric System

Did you know that NASA once lost a $125 million Mars orbiter because one team used metric units and another used imperial units? Measurement confusion is not just annoying; it can be expensive.

## The Metric System (SI)

The **International System of Units (SI)**, or metric system, is used by 95% of the world. It's based on powers of 10, making it incredibly logical.
- **Length**: Meter (m)
- **Mass**: Kilogram (kg)
- **Volume**: Liter (L)

## The Imperial System

Used primarily by the United States, Liberia, and Myanmar. It's based on historical definitions that can be confusing.
- **Length**: Inch, Foot, Yard, Mile
- **Mass**: Ounce, Pound, Ton
- **Volume**: Fluid Ounce, Pint, Gallon

## Common Conversions

Here are some quick conversions you might need:

*   **1 Inch** = 2.54 Centimeters
*   **1 Mile** = 1.609 Kilometers
*   **1 Kilogram** = 2.204 Pounds
*   **1 Gallon (US)** = 3.785 Liters

## Why Conversion Matters

Whether you're cooking a recipe from another country or working on an international engineering project, accurate conversion is vital.
