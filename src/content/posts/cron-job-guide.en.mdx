# Master Cron Expressions: A Developer's Guide

If you are a developer or system administrator, you've likely encountered the cryptic string `* * * * *`. This is a **Cron expression**, the standard way to schedule tasks on Unix-like systems.

## What is Cron?

Cron is a time-based job scheduler. It allows you to run scripts or commands automatically at specific intervals (e.g., every minute, every day at midnight, every Monday).

## Understanding the Syntax

A standard Cron expression consists of 5 fields:

```
* * * * *
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ └── Day of Week (0 - 7) (Sunday is 0 or 7)
│ │ │ └──── Month (1 - 12)
│ │ └────── Day of Month (1 - 31)
│ └──────── Hour (0 - 23)
└────────── Minute (0 - 59)
```

### Common Examples

| Expression | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `* * * * *` | Run every minute |
| `0 * * * *` | Run at the start of every hour |
| `0 0 * * *` | Run every day at midnight |
| `0 9 * * 1` | Run every Monday at 9:00 AM |
| `*/5 * * * *` | Run every 5 minutes |

## Special Characters

- **`*` (Asterisk)**: Matches any value.
- **`,` (Comma)**: Separates items (e.g., `1,3,5` means 1st, 3rd, and 5th).
- **`-` (Hyphen)**: Defines a range (e.g., `1-5` means 1 to 5).
- **`/` (Slash)**: Defines steps (e.g., `*/10` means every 10 units).
