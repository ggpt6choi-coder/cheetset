# How to Create Uncrackable Passwords (and Why It Matters)

In the digital age, your password is the only thing standing between your personal information and cybercriminals. Yet, "123456" and "password" remain among the most common passwords used worldwide.

## How Hackers Crack Passwords

To create a strong password, you first need to understand how hackers try to break them.

### 1. Brute Force Attacks
Hackers use software to try every possible combination of characters.
- **Short passwords** (e.g., 6 characters) can be cracked in **milliseconds**.
- **Long passwords** (e.g., 12+ characters) take **centuries** to crack.

### 2. Dictionary Attacks
Hackers use lists of common words and phrases. If your password is "sunshine" or "iloveyou", it will be cracked instantly.

## What Makes a Password Strong?

The strength of a password is determined by its **Entropy** (randomness).

1.  **Length**: This is the most important factor. A 12-character password is exponentially stronger than an 8-character one.
2.  **Complexity**: Mix uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
3.  **Unpredictability**: Avoid common patterns like "QWERTY" or "1234".

## How to Create a Strong Password

Creating a random string like `9#kL2$mP` is secure but hard to remember. Here are two strategies:

### Strategy 1: The Passphrase Method
Combine 3-4 random words that are unrelated.
*   **Weak**: `MyDogIsCute` (Common phrase)
*   **Strong**: `Coffee-Planet-Jump-Purple` (High entropy, easy to remember)

### Strategy 2: Use a Password Generator
For maximum security, let a computer generate true randomness for you.
